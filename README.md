# Assorted Shell Scripts
I'm learning bash scripting so here's the repo for simple scripts I make to do stuff around my system.

## Clear Pictures
Moves into a chosen directory and removes all files following a chosen pattern. I use it to clear my screenshots folder, hence the name.

## JRNL Reset
Clears my org-mode journal file and writes the appropriate metadata back into it to allow it to be picked up by my capture template.

## Sort Files
Runs through a series of operations to move various file types in my downloads folder into appropriate subfolders of my Documents folder. Never leaving a bunch of junk in my downloads again!
